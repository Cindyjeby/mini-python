Number-Guessing Game
This game often serves as the first project for many coders. The program generates a random number, the user makes a guess as to what the number is, and the program responds with clues (e.g., “too high”, “too low”) until the user guesses correctly. The program also counts the number of attempts required to guess the number.

This project introduces coders to Python modules, which you can import from an existing library. Many modules are available, including those that generate random numbers. To write the program, users first will import a random-number module into their code. Modules such as this help simplify the coding process.

Skills Tested
In addition to learning about modules, programmers will have the chance to hone their skills with inputs, variables, statements such as “if” and “else,” and while loops. Broadly, these factors can aid a coder’s general understanding of text-based commands; specifically as they pertain to numeric algorithms and mathematical accuracy.
