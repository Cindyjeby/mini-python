 Mad Libs Generator
Many of us have played Mad Libs with friends, where you asked for a variety of nouns, verbs, or adjectives to complete in a prewritten story. While Mad Libs are entertaining on paper, they are also a great way to practice your Python coding skills. 

This is a popular programming exercise for newcomers — one that Python sites pitch as a great project for kids. The concept is quite simple: write the text of your story, leaving openings for the specific inputs (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) for which you will ask. Once the user adds those inputs, your Python code will complete the story. The story can be as long and as creative as you like.

Skills Tested
Writing a Mad Libs program makes you more comfortable working with strings and variables. A key element of Python, this is a method of storing sequences of data — usually numbers, symbols, or words. This project also teaches the various ways to perform string concatenation, which is the process of combining strings.
